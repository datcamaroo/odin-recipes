    <h2>Here is my recipe for the perfect sushi rice. You can eat this alone or roll into your favorite sushi roll with ingredients of choice. I use strips of carrots, cucumbers and slices of avocado. You can adjust the amount of vinegar in this recipe to suit your taste.    </h2>

    <p>Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method. It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients, cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls.</p>

    <p>The best rice for sushi is short-grain Japanese rice — this is what's in the bags labeled "sushi rice" at the store.This glutinous rice has a higher starch content than other varieties, which gives it the sticky texture you're after when you make sushi.</p>

    <p>Classic sushi rice is seasoned with just rice vinegar, white sugar, and salt. This recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of a bolder oil, so the simple seasonings have a chance to really shine.    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)        </li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup rice vinegar        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil        </li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.        </li>
        <li>Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running water until the water runs clear.        </li>
        <li>Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and all water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from stove and set aside until cool enough to handle.        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool, then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools.        </li>
    </ol>
